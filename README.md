# Animated Login with Flutter and Rive

This is a login screen project using Flutter and Rive. The animated character reacts to what you type in the email and password fields, making the login experience more interactive.

## Features

The bear follows what you type in the email field.

When typing in the password field, the bear covers its eyes automatically.

If you stop typing for a while, the bear looks forward again.

Simple login validation:

User: cristian@gmail.com

Password: 123456

Success and fail animations are triggered when pressing the login button.

Toggle to show/hide the password.
